# Mashup Generator – Web Application

This project is a **Web-based Mashup Generator** developed as part of an academic assignment.

The application allows a user to generate an audio mashup by providing:
- Singer name
- Number of videos
- Duration of each video
- Email ID

The mashup is generated by downloading videos from YouTube, converting them into audio clips, trimming them, and merging them into a single output file.
